🛡️ Network Penetration Testing with Real-World Exploits and Security Remediation

This project simulates real-world network attacks and defense strategies using Kali Linux as the attacker machine and Metasploitable as the target. It includes scanning, enumeration, exploitation, password cracking, and remediation — all performed in a controlled lab environment for ethical learning purposes.

 * Objectives

Understand and simulate real-world network attacks
Perform scanning, enumeration, and exploitation using tools like Nmap and Metasploit
Crack Linux password hashes using John the Ripper
Identify outdated services and recommend security remediations

💻 Lab Setup

🖥️ Operating Systems
Kali Linux – Attacker Machine
Metasploitable 2 – Target Machine

Tools Used
nmap – Port, OS, and service version scanning
Metasploit – Exploitation
John the Ripper – Password hash cracking
Linux built-in commands – user management and enumeration

🚀 Tasks Performed

Network Scanning

nmap -v IP – Basic scan
nmap -v -p- IP – Full port scan
nmap -sV IP – Service version detection
nmap -O IP – OS detection


🔐 Hidden Ports Discovered

Ports like 8787, 36588, 53204, etc., found through full port scans.

📡 Enumeration
OS: Linux 2.6.x (Metasploitable)
Open services: vsftpd, OpenSSH, Apache, MySQL, Samba, etc.
Vulnerable ports: 21 (FTP), 445 (SMB), 512–514 (R Services)

💥 Exploitation
vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor

👤 Privilege Escalation
Created user sanjana with root permissions
Extracted and cracked password hash using John the Ripper

🔧 Remediation Steps
Service	Vulnerability	Fix
vsftpd	Backdoor (CVE-2011-2523)	Upgrade to 3.0.5 / use SFTP


📚 Major Learning
Through this project, I learned how to create and manage users in Linux, analyze system files, crack password hashes, and detect services using Nmap. I practiced using commands like nmap -sV, nmap -O, and john to identify system weaknesses. I also understood how outdated service like FTP services pose serious security risks and how to patch or replace them.
